New feature release.

* add ability to convert ReST to Markdown, Python .py files, clear and full
  Jupyter notebooks;
* add ``mpl-interactive`` directive to signal presence of ``%matplotlib``
  commands in notebook and ReST;
* add ``code-links`` directive to add links to versions of ReST file as
  Python ``.py`` file, clear and full notebooks;
* add ability to configure alternative versions of nbplot directives according
  to build-time configuration;
* add directive to allow page-specific configuration for the directive
  alternative machinery;
* add more general Sphinx testing machinery;
* commit to setuptools;
* improve conversion of matplotlib objects from output cells to doctest output
  in ReST page;
* start basic documentation;
* minor API breakage - do not split nbplot code blocks at ``plt.show()``.  I
  discovered this horrible hack left over from the matplotlib plot directive
  when refactoring, and removed it to make refactoring easier;
* minor API breakage - do not write individual nbplot directives as ``.py``
  files; they don't make much sense for nbplot use, and the code was not
  linking to these files in any case;

New feature release.

* ``nb2plots`` script now always outputs converted notebooks as UTF-8, rather
  than doing a ``print()`` to stdout;
* add ``raises`` option to ``nbplot`` directive, to test that nbplot blocks to
  raise errors while building the HTML;
* fix CI testing to actually run on Python 3.3-3.5.
