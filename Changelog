New feature release.

* ``nb2plots`` script now always outputs converted notebooks as UTF-8, rather
  than doing a ``print()`` to stdout;
* add ``raises`` option to ``nbplot`` directive, to test that nbplot blocks to
  raise errors while building the HTML;
* fix CI testing to actually run on Python 3.3-3.5.
